    "A very useful feature of python is that we can setup and work with environments. Each environment is a unique workspace where you can install a specific versions of python and its packages. This makes it possible to for instance work with python 3.4 in one workspace and python 3.8 in another. It also prevents unwanted interactions between different works. It is recommended to create a new environment for each project that you work on. This way, mistakes in one project do not affect the other projects. Also, updates in one environment do not affect updates in other environments, so you can for instance work with older versions of certain packages.
